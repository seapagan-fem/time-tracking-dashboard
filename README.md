## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Plain Javascipt
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I chose to use Radio buttons for the Daily/Weekly/Monthly selectors and style
them accordingly which simplified the JS logic a lot. I had originally intended
to use a styled list but think this is better.

I'm generally happy with the JS and think its quite clean and straight forward.

The time data is taken live from the JSON file, and I enjoyed parsing that and
filtering the data depending on which period is selected.

Styling was quite fun too, and getting the cards correct was more difficult
than it seemed at first glance. I styled mobile-first, and after that the
desktop version was very easy.
